# TSP-Planning-for-Mobile-Robot

# About
A Matlab version of TSP Planning including doubling-tree heuristic and Christofide's heuristic.

# Intro
The problem is design trajectory for a mobile robot with the given 10 locations in the map.
This project has two main parts. The first is to explore the impact of different configurations on the type of Dubin's path, and the second is to use minimum spanning tree and some TSP (traveling salesman problem)  Heuristics, including doubling-tree heuristic and Christofide's heuristic, to obtain the TSP order. Dubins_Curve.m and Dubins_core.m are wrote by Ewing Kang, the code can be found at https://github.com/EwingKang/Dubins-Curve-For-MATLAB.

# Example
Directly run the graphProject.m, or using ctrl+enter run the desired section including MST part, doubling tree TSP part and Christofide's Algorithm part.
